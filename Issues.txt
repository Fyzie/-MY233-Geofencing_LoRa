GPS reading - bad reading under zinc roof, otherwise, base accuracy: +-3 meters
Lora communication interval - node takes time to match frequency to the gateway (cant be real time)

Next Development:
1. Reduce freqeuency interval (control freq) : going to be edited in "lorabase.h" (for now, the node runs for 64 channels(902.3:0.2:914.9); 1(@907.5) out of 64 channels did sent the data)
2. Unique ID for each node : Device Address
3. Manage sleep mode only after data transmission is successful (@907.5 Hz) 

Note:
SLEEP MODE ->
Average current used: 0.20 A
Low power mode: 0.13 A - 0.15 A
