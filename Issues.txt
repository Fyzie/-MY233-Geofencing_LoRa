GPS reading - bad reading under zinc roof, otherwise, base accuracy: 3+ meters
Lora communication interval - node takes time to match frequency to the gateway (cant be real time)

Possible Improvement:
1. Fasten the package delivery (control freq) : can be edited in "lorabase.h"
2. Input from user (for home position)
3. Unique ID for each node
